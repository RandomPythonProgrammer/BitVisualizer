# BitVisualizer

This tool allows you to visualize the bitboard for creating chess engines.

# Controls

Click and/or drag on the squares to toggle bits on or off. The white is `0` and the red is `1`. 

- `enter` copies the hex representation to your clipboard.
- `1` fills the bitboard with `1`s.
- `0` fills the bitboard with `0`s.
- `~` inverts the bits on the bitboard.


# Feedback

Feel free to give any feedback and I will try my best to improve the tool.
